## [XYZ Investment Cab Industry](https://github.com/G-Tox/W2)
* EDA: City Analysis, payment method analysis, seasonality analysis, income analysis, customer retention analysis.
* Created a tool that estimates rides profit.
* Deployment of the model with Flask and Heroku.


## [Facial Recognition AWS](https://github.com/G-Tox/flask_recog)
* Create a demo Web App that use services from AWS like Rekognition, DynamoDB, S3, Lambda, API Gateway Endpoint to deploy a facial recognition model. This model can be used to resolve problems like autenthification, digital signed, citizen security, attendance control, exam control, etc.
* Scraped over 1500 faces for the testing of the model using Python and BeautifulSoup.

## Open/close eyes detection model
* The main aim for this model is detect when a eye is open or closed. For this task is necessary extract only the part where are the eyes from each people face, because the model is of classification not detection. MTCNN face detector was used for the identification of the eyes.
* Packages: Keras, TensorFlow, OpenCV.
* The application of this model can be used in face liveness detection.
