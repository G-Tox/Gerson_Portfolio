## [Facial Recognition AWS](https://github.com/G-Tox/flask_recog)
Create a demo Web App that use services from AWS like Rekognition, DynamoDB, S3, Lambda, API Gateway Endpoint to deploy a facial recognition model. This model can be used to resolve problems like autenthification, digital signed, citizen security, attendance control, exam control, etc.

## Face liveness detection with open/close eyes random
* The main aim for this model is detect when a eye is open or closed. For this task is necessary extract only the part where are the eyes from each people face, because the model is of classification not detection. MTCNN face detector was used for the identification of the eyes.
* Packages: Keras, TensorFlow, OpenCV.
* The application of this model can be used in face liveness detection.
